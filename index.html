          Hi, we are Linda and Istvan Takacs, and we are so happy that you found
          us!
        </h3>
        <p>
          We are a husband and wife duo who live the life of art. We specialize
          in Studio Newborn and Baby's First Year Photography. We are located in
          McKinney TX and we serve McKinney, Plano, Prosper, Celina, Little Elm
          and surrounding areas. Our goal is to create award winning images of
          you and your loved ones, for you to have and display proudly in your
          home for years to come. To us its not just about capturing moments,
          its also about CREATING beautiful memories that will last a lifetime
          and give you the warm fuzzies all over again every time that you look
          at them. Those little details: the pouty lips, the tiny fingers, the
          itty bitty toes are priceless. We have won international competitions
          with our newborn images, competing against some of the biggest names
          in the industry . We believe that simplicity is elegance. Our work is
          focused on the subject, the feelings and not so much on props and
          distractions. We look forward to meeting you and your loved ones and
          being part of this amazing journey with you!
